**CheapestBuy.AI: Your AI-Powered Grocery Assistant**

CheapestBuy.AI is a smart grocery shopping assistant that helps users find the best and most affordable grocery deals in Pakistan. It uses a CrewAI framework to mimic a team of experts who work together to collect user input, search the web, compare products, analyze reviews, and provide clear recommendations.

**üöÄ Features**

**Intelligent Agent Crew:** A team of specialized AI agents works together to fulfill your request.

**Input Collector:** Gathers and clarifies your grocery needs.

**Web Search Specialist:** Searches for products across major Pakistani grocery stores like Carrefour, Metro, and Imtiaz.

**Product Comparison Expert:** Analyzes and ranks the top 3 product options based on price, delivery time, and ratings.

**Review Analyzer:** Summarizes customer reviews to provide pros and cons.

**Recommendation Specialist:** Presents a final, easy-to-read summary of the top deals.

**Voice and Text Input:** You can ask for groceries by typing or speaking your request.

**Customizable Filters:** Apply optional filters for minimum rating or preferred brand to refine your search.

**Structured Recommendations:** The final output provides a clear, organized view of the top options, including price, rating, and a purchase link.

**‚öôÔ∏è How It Works**
The application is built on Streamlit for the user interface and CrewAI for the AI workflow. The process is sequential:

**User Input:** The user provides a grocery query via text or voice.

**Input Processing:** The Grocery Input Collector agent refines the query and applies any specified filters.

**Web Search:** The Web Search Specialist agent uses web scraping tools (SerperDevTool, ScrapeWebsiteTool) to find product listings.

**Analysis & Ranking:** The Grocery Product Comparison Expert ranks the fetched results to find the best deals.

**Review Summary:** The Grocery Review Analyzer processes product reviews to highlight pros and cons.

**Final Recommendation:** The Grocery Shopping Recommendation Specialist compiles a final, comprehensive summary for the user.
